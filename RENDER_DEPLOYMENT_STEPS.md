# 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP: Deploy Your App to Render.com (LIVE)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What You Need to Know

**GitHub URL is NOT your live app URL.** GitHub only stores code. You need to deploy to a hosting service to make it live.

Your GitHub URL: https://github.com/Afna-Fathima/experiment-8 (code repository)  
Your LIVE App URL will be: https://fitness-app.onrender.com (after deployment)
