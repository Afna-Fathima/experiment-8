## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

Your app has been developed and pushed to GitHub. **But GitHub doesn't host websites** - it only stores code.

**Q: Is Render free?**
A: Yes! Free tier includes up to 750 hours/month, which is plenty for your app.

**Q: Will my app auto-update after deployment?**
A: Yes! Every time you push code to GitHub, Render automatically redeploys your app.

**Q: What if I get an error during deployment?**
A: Check the RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md file in your repo for troubleshooting steps.
